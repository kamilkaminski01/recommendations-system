  Recommendations System
</h1>

This project is aimed at organizations that can leverage it
for recruitment and advertisement. It allows registered users
to invite potential customers for various rewards.

## Resources

Issue tracking is handled by
[Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/pl/software/jira).

The code repository is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Dimateos12/Project-recommendations).

## Running from sources

### Docker Compose setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dimateos12/Project-recommendations
cd Project-recommendations/
make build
make run
```

[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is leveraged
for reproducible builds and consistent local development environments.
The default [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) file is set up
to support local development with code reload and debug mode.

[`Makefile`](Makefile) contains common commands that can be used to
build, run, and test the project. The most important commands include:
- `build`: builds the project with Docker Compose.
- `run`: runs the project with Docker Compose.
- `check`: performs backend static code checks.
- `frontcheck`: performs frontend static code checks.
- `pytest`: runs backend unit tests
- `pytest_module module={module_name}`: runs backend unit tests in passed module
- `clear`: stops the currently running services and removes the volumes.

When using a local Python environment, [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/)
should be installed and ran on staged files to ensure that the code
quality standards are met.

### Application setup

After running the application, the following actions should be executed:

Run `make initial-data` to initialize the database with example data including:
  - global superuser (admin@admin.com)
  - recommenders (users):
    - first recommender (kamil@recommender.com)
    - second recommender (adam@recommender.com)
    - third recommender (mateusz@recommender.com)
  - company admins (users):
    - first company admin (janusz@microsoft.com)
    - second company admin (dorota@pzu.com)
    - third company admin (hubert@apple.com)
  - advertisements:
    - first advertisement (Apple)
    - second advertisement (PZU)
    - third advertisement (Microsoft)
  - shop rewards:
    - first reward (iPhone 14 pro)
    - second reward (MacBook Pro M1)
    - third reward (Gift Card)

#### Troubleshooting

In case of errors with typing or missing dependencies, try to rebuild the
Docker images:

```bash
make clear
docker compose up --build --force-recreate
```

If `make` is not supported, the associated Docker Compose commands can be
used directly in order to build and run the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dimateos12/Project-recommendations
cd Project-recommendations/
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

## Code quality standards

`main` is the stable branch used for releases.

Features should be verified with automated unit tests, including
the expected "happy paths" as well as edge cases that might cause issues
or errors.

Git branches should be named according to the
[Git Flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) methodology.
Always include the IDs of the associated tasks in the branches and commit
names. For example:

```bash
# Branches:
feature/UR-42/add-candidate-model
fix/UR-52/missing-email-bug

# Commit names:
UR-42 | Add candidate model
```

### Backend

All backend code must be formatted and verified by the `black`, `flake8`,
`mypy` and `isort` tools. Their configurations can be found in the
[.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file.

Custom functions and methods should use **type hints** to improve IDE code
completions, prevent from type errors and extend code documentation.

### Frontend

All frontend code must be formatted and verified by the `prettier`
and `eslint` tools.
